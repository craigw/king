# King

On August 28, 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his speech, "I have a
Dream," in which he called for racial equality. You can hear the speech at
http://open.spotify.com/track/2nhqOHMEz6gGQKLsGYVRkI and you can read it at
http://www.usconstitution.net/dream.html.

This application is an attempt to make webpages available in audio form.

## Running the application

You'll want the server component of [Bach](https://github.com/craigw/bach)
running on your local machine. It's enough to clone the Bach project and follow
the "up and running fast" section in the
[Bach README](https://github.com/craigw/bach#readme).

Once that's running you can start King like this:

    cd /path/to/king
    bundle
    bundle exec ruby king.rb

By default King listens on port 4567. Visit it in a web browser:

    http://localhost:4567
